# About Me
I am interested in using mathematical model to understand ecological dynamics and evolutionary processes in different biological systems. I am currently studying the mechanisms underlying cyanobacteria bloom in fresh lake water in Switzerland.
In addition, I am also interested in the symbiotic dynamics (including both parasitism and mutualism). On a side project with Dr. Chaitanya Gokhale (University of Wurzburg), I study the evolutionary outcomes of host manipulation in trophically transmitted parasites.
